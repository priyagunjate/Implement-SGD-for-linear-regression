# Implement-SGD-for-linear-regression
0.1  Implement SGD for linear regression To implement stochastic gradient descent to optimize a linear regression algorithm on Boston House Prices dataset which is already exists in sklearn as a sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.here,SGD algorithm is defined manually and then comapring the both results.Linear regression is technique to predict on real values. 

##### stochastic gradient descent technique , evaluates and updates the coefficients every iteration to minimize the error of a model on training data. 





0.2 Objective:

• To Implement stochastic gradient descent on Bostan House Prices dataset for linear Regression

• Implement SGD and deploy on Bostan House Prices dataset. 

• Comapare the Results with sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor
